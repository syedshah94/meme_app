Meme Review App (React Front-End / Rails Back-End)

Heroku link: https://memes-app.herokuapp.com/

Update to readme doc coming soon... (it's me from the future, no update found)

Basically:
Single page application, rendering different views based on authentication status. 
Conditional rendering occurs based on user actions such as correct or incorrect actions.
Uses of React router, Bulma.io adjusted to be compatible with React, responsive design. 

Few easter eggs...
